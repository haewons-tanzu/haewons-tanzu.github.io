categories: [demo, tap]

TAP (Tanzu Application Platform) was released in last January 2022. I created 4 short demos for customers to easily understand and use TAP for each use case. 

These are divided into 4 short videos as below:
- [Part1](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/tap-demos/tap-developing-in-ide) - Developing in IDE
This shows for developers to start developing their code in IDE. It introduces how developers can start development and debug code developed in Kubernetes development environment.
- [Part2](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/tap-demos/tap-deploying-an-application) - App Deployment
This shows how to deploy applications from source code to Kubernetes environment. Unlike the existing way of creating and deploying an image with a Dockerfile, you can easily deploy applications with a single Tanzu command.
- [Part3](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/tap-demos/tap-managing-and-monitoring-workloads) - TAP GUI
This shows how to manage and monitor workloads which are deployed application on Kubernetes. TAP provides TAP UI for this, and this is very familiar for developers who are using Spring Boot.
- [Part4](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/tap-demos/tap-api-portal) - API Portal
This shows API Portal which is contained in TAP. It explains what's better compared to Swagger UI.

You can see them in [Tanzu web page](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/tap-demos).
