title: TAP Webinar - An Efficient Way to Improve Your Kubernetes-Based App Development Productivity
categories: [demo, tap]
---

As organisations rapidly embrace Kubernetes, developers are often left with an overwhelming landscape of incoherent tools that are tough to set up and work inconsistently across teams. Connecting them to other apps and infrastructure is extremely complex and forces developers to spend too much time grappling with underlying infrastructure vs. writing innovative code.

Are you looking for an easy and convenient way to enable your developers to build, deploy and manage applications on any Kubernetes platform?

In this session we will discuss how you can provide an environment where your developers can focus on writing code:
- Rapidly build and test applications regardless of your Kubernetes knowledge
- Automatically update code commits or patches for built containers by creating security and compliance application templates
- Accelerate your path to production with seamless app handoffs from Dev to production
